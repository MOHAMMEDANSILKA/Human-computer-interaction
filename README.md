# Human-computer-interaction
 Switching on and off an AC device using a hand tap and algorithm for tracking the hand position to   choose which device to operate

 The project aims to revolutionize human-device interaction by developing an innovative system with hand gestures for controlling electronic devices.
Integrate facial gesture recognition sensors, and hand gesture recognition sensors into a unified system architecture. Ensure seamless synchronization and communication between sensors to capture and process physiological signals accurately.
By detecting key landmarks and movements of the hand, the system enables users to control and interact with software applications and hardware devices through a variety of gestures. The project encompasses the design, implementation, and evaluation of the gesture recognition system, with a focus on usability, accuracy, and responsiveness. Through user testing and evaluation, the project aims to validate the effectiveness and user experience of the gesture-based interaction paradigm
 Traditional input methods such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens impose limitations on accessibility, mobility, and user experience. By harnessing physiological signals from eye movements, facial expressions, and hand gestures, the project seeks to create intuitive, hands-free interfaces that enable users to interact with electronic devices, computers, and software applications in entirely unconventional ways.
